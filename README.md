| **[Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models can be effective for forecasting the dynamics of unknown systems from time-series data, but they often require large amounts of data and struggle to generalize across systems with varying dynamics. Combined, these issues make forecasting from short time series particularly challenging. To address this problem, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting from Related Time Series (METAFORS), which uses related systems with longer time-series data to supplement limited data from the system of interest. By leveraging a library of models trained on related systems, METAFORS builds tailored models to forecast system evolution with limited data. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate METAFORS' ability to predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics, even when test and related systems exhibit significantly different behaviors and the available data are scarce, highlighting its robustness and versatility in data-limited scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[CENTS: Generating synthetic electricity consumption time series for rare and unseen scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14426v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large-scale generative modeling have demonstrated the potential of foundation models in domains such as natural language, computer vision, and protein structure prediction. However, their application in the energy and smart grid sector remains limited due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of high-quality data. In this work, we propose a method for creating high-fidelity electricity consumption time series data for rare and unseen context variables (e.g. location, building type, photovoltaics). Our approach, Context Encoding and Normalizing Time Series Generation, or CENTS, includes three key innovations: (i) A context normalization approach that enables inverse transformation for time series context variables unseen during training, (ii) a novel context encoder to condition any state-of-the-art time-series generator on arbitrary numbers and combinations of context variables, (iii) a framework for training this context encoder jointly with a time-series generator using an auxiliary context classification loss designed to increase expressivity of context embeddings and improve model performance. We further provide a comprehensive overview of different evaluation metrics for generative time series models. Our results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in generating realistic household-level electricity consumption data, paving the way for training larger foundation models in the energy domain on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/LancelotXWX/SWIFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning Helps Cross-institutional Knowledge Transfer: A Study in Pediatric Ventilation Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13587v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical machine learning deployment across institutions faces significant challenges when patient populations and clinical practices differ substantially. We present a systematic framework for cross-institutional knowledge transfer in clinical time series, demonstrated through pediatric ventilation management between a general pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a cardiac-focused unit. Using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning, we investigate how different data regimes and fine-tuning strategies affect knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Our results show that while direct model transfer performs poorly, CPC with appropriate fine-tuning enables effective knowledge sharing between institutions, with benefits particularly evident in limited data scenarios. Analysis of transfer patterns reveals an important asymmetry: temporal progression patterns transfer more readily than point-of-care decisions, suggesting practical pathways for cross-institutional deployment. Through a systematic evaluation of fine-tuning approaches and transfer patterns, our work provides insights for developing more generalizable clinical decision support systems while enabling smaller specialized units to leverage knowledge from larger centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'25 |
| **[TimeHF: Billion-Scale Time Series Models Guided by Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15942v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series neural networks perform exceptionally well in real-world applications but encounter challenges such as limited scalability, poor generalization, and suboptimal zero-shot performance. Inspired by large language models, there is interest in developing large time series models (LTM) to address these issues. However, current methods struggle with training complexity, adapting human feedback, and achieving high predictive accuracy. We introduce TimeHF, a novel pipeline for creating LTMs with 6 billion parameters, incorporating human feedback. We use patch convolutional embedding to capture long time series information and design a human feedback mechanism called time-series policy optimization. Deployed in JD.com's supply chain, TimeHF handles automated replenishment for over 20,000 products, improving prediction accuracy by 33.21% over existing methods. This work advances LTM technology and shows significant industrial benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-Graphormer: Using Transformers for Spatiotemporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13274v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data is ubiquitous, and forecasting it has important applications in many domains. However, its complex spatial dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics can be challenging for traditional techniques. Existing methods tackle these challenges by learning the two dimensions separately. Here, we introduce Temporal Graphormer (T-Graphormer), a Transformer-based approach capable of modelling spatiotemporal correlations simultaneously. By incorporating temporal dynamics in the Graphormer architecture, each node attends to all other nodes within the graph sequence. Our design enables the model to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns with minimal reliance on predefined spacetime inductive biases. We validate the effectiveness of T-Graphormer on real-world traffic prediction benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, T-Graphormer reduces root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by up to 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Reservoir Computing for Chaotic Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15615v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing was shown in recent years to be useful as efficient to learn networks in the field of time series tasks. Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

| **[Guaranteed Multidimensional Time Series Prediction via Deterministic Tensor Completion Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15388v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the prediction of multidimensional time series data has become increasingly important due to its wide-ranging applications. Tensor-based prediction methods have gained attention for their ability to preserve the inherent structure of such data. However, existing approaches, such as tensor autoregression and tensor decomposition, often have consistently failed to provide clear assertions regarding the number of samples that can be exactly predicted. While matrix-based methods using nuclear norms address this limitation, their reliance on matrices limits accuracy and increases computational costs when handling multidimensional data. To overcome these challenges, we reformulate multidimensional time series prediction as a deterministic tensor completion problem and propose a novel theoretical framework. Specifically, we develop a deterministic tensor completion theory and introduce the Temporal Convolutional Tensor Nuclear Norm (TCTNN) model. By convolving the multidimensional time series along the temporal dimension and applying the tensor nuclear norm, our approach identifies the maximum forecast horizon for exact predictions. Additionally, TCTNN achieves superior performance in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods across diverse real-world datasets, including climate temperature, network flow, and traffic ride data. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/TCTNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Transfer Learning Framework for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Traffic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15365v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, rapid technological advancements and expanded Internet access have led to a significant rise in anomalies within network traffic and time-series data. Prompt detection of these irregularities is crucial for ensuring service quality, preventing financial losses, and maintaining robust security standards. While machine learning algorithms have shown promise in achieving high accuracy for anomaly detection, their performance is often constrained by the specific conditions of their training data. A persistent challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled data for anomaly detection in time-series datasets. This limitation hampers the training efficacy of both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models. To address this, unsupervised transfer learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging unlabeled data from a source domain to identify anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, many existing approaches still depend on a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. To overcome these constraints, we propose a transfer learning-based model for anomaly detection in multivariate time-series datasets. Unlike conventional methods, our approach does not require labeled data in either the source or target domains. Empirical evaluations on novel intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing techniques in accurately identifying anomalies within an entirely unlabeled target domain.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Stochastic Volatility under Informative Missingness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15297v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic volatility models that treat the variance of a time series as a stochastic process have proven to be important tools for analyzing dynamic variability. Current methods for fitting and conducting inference on stochastic volatility models are limited by the assumption that any missing data are missing at random. With a recent explosion in technology to facilitate the collection of dynamic self-response data for which mechanisms underlying missing data are inherently scientifically informative, this limitation in statistical methodology also limits scientific advancement. The goal of this article is to develop the first statistical methodology for modeling, fitting, and conducting inference on stochastic volatility with data that are missing not at random. The approach is based upon a novel imputation method derived using Tukey's representation, which utilizes the Markovian nature of stochastic volatility models to overcome unidentifiable components often faced when modeling informative missingness in other settings. This imputation method is combined with a new conditional particle filtering with ancestor sampling procedure that accounts for variability in imputation to formulate a complete particle Gibbs sampling scheme. The use of the method is illustrated through the analysis of mobile phone self-reported mood from individuals being monitored after unsuccessful suicide attempts.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 to...</summary><p>41 total pages, 1 cover page, 27 pages main text, 4 pages references, 9 pages appendices, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Grid Monitoring with Synchro-Waveform and AI Foundation Model Technologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose:This article advocates for the development of a next-generation grid monitoring and control system designed for future grids dominated by inverter-based resources. Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages. Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed. Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ister: Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer for Explainable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18798v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term time series forecasting, Transformer-based models have achieved great success, due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing models face challenges in identifying critical components for prediction, leading to limited interpretability and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose the Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting. Ister decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, further modeling multi-periodicity and inter-series dependencies using a Dual Transformer architecture. We introduce a novel Dot-attention mechanism that improves interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ister outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 10% improvement in MSE. Moreover, Ister enables intuitive visualization of component contributions, shedding lights on model's decision process and enhancing transparency in prediction results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Determining The Number of Factors in Two-Way Factor Model of High-Dimensional Matrix-Variate Time Series: A White-Noise based Method for Serial Correlation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13614v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study a new two-way factor model for high-dimensional matrix-variate time series. To estimate the number of factors in this two-way factor model, we decompose the series into two parts: one being a non-weakly correlated series and the other being a weakly correlated noise. By comparing the difference between two series, we can construct white-noise based signal statistics to determine the number of factors in row loading matrix (column loading matrix). Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact on the accuracy of the estimation, which is caused by the interaction between the row loading matrix and the column loading matrix, we propose a transformation so that the transformed model only contains the row loading matrix (column loading matrix). We define sequences of ratios of two test statistics as signal statistics to determine the number of factors and derive the consistence of the estimation. We implement the numerical studies to examine the performance of the new methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review on Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15196v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection presents various challenges due to the sequential and dynamic nature of time-dependent data. Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqMoE: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Frequency Decomposition Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15125v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting is essential in areas like finance and weather prediction. Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain, many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Mixture of Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Prediction and Explanation in Time-Series Transformers via Shapley-based Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15070v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose ShapTST, a framework that enables time-series transformers to efficiently generate Shapley-value-based explanations alongside predictions in a single forward pass. Shapley values are widely used to evaluate the contribution of different time-steps and features in a test sample, and are commonly generated through repeatedly inferring on each sample with different parts of information removed. Therefore, it requires expensive inference-time computations that occur at every request for model explanations. In contrast, our framework unifies the explanation and prediction in training through a novel Shapley-based pre-training design, which eliminates the undesirable test-time computation and replaces it with a single-time pre-training. Moreover, this specialized pre-training benefits the prediction performance by making the transformer model more effectively weigh different features and time-steps in the time-series, particularly improving the robustness against data noise that is common to raw time-series data. We experimentally validated our approach on eight public datasets, where our time-series model achieved competitive results in both classification and regression tasks, while providing Shapley-based explanations similar to those obtained with post-hoc computation. Our work offers an efficient and explainable solution for time-series analysis tasks in the safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted to 21st IEEE CSPA 2025</p></details> |

Smart homes is one such domain where bulk of data is being generated and anomaly detection is one of the many challenges addressed by researchers in recent years. Contextual anomaly is a kind of anomaly that may show deviation from the normal pattern like point or sequence anomalies, but it also requires prior knowledge about the data domain and the actions that caused the deviation. Recent studies based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have demonstrated strong performance in anomaly detection. This study explores the impact of automatically tuned hyperparamteres on Unsupervised Online Contextual Anomaly Detection (UoCAD) approach by proposing UoCAD with Optimised Hyperparamnters (UoCAD-OH). UoCAD-OH conducts hyperparameter optimisation on Bi-LSTM model in an offline phase and uses the fine-tuned hyperparameters to detect anomalies during the online phase. The experiments involve evaluating the proposed framework on two smart home air quality datasets containing contextual anomalies. The evaluation metrics used are Precision, Recall, and F1 score.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Harnessing Contrastive Learning and Neural Transformation for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07898v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays a vital role in many industrial applications. While contrastive learning has gained momentum in the time series domain for its prowess in extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, its straightforward application to anomaly detection is not without hurdles. Firstly, contrastive learning typically requires negative sampling to avoid the representation collapse issue, where the encoder converges to a constant solution. However, drawing from the same dataset for dissimilar samples is ill-suited for TSAD as most samples are ``normal'' in the training dataset. Secondly, conventional contrastive learning focuses on instance discrimination, which may overlook anomalies that are detectable when compared to their temporal context. In this study, we propose a novel approach, CNT, that incorporates a window-based contrastive learning strategy fortified with learnable transformations. This dual configuration focuses on capturing temporal anomalies in local regions while simultaneously mitigating the representation collapse issue. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of CNT in circumventing constant encoder solutions. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world industrial datasets, we show the superiority of our framework by outperforming various baselines and model variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling real-world irregular time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024), Spotlight presentation (Notable Top 5%). https://openreview.net/forum?id=4VIgNuQ1pY</p></details> |

This paper proposes an alternative to Poisson autoregressions: count echo state networks. Echo state networks can be statistically analyzed in frequentist manners via optimizing penalized likelihoods, or in Bayesian manners via MCMC sampling. This paper develops Poisson echo state techniques for count data and applies them to a massive count data set containing the number of graduate students from 1,758 United States universities during the years 1972-2021 inclusive. Negative binomial models are also implemented to better handle overdispersion in the counts. Performance of the proposed models are compared via their forecasting performance as judged by several methods. In the end, a hierarchical negative binomial based echo state network is judged as the superior model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MMD: Multi-Domain Multimodal Dataset for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08627v4)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first-cut multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data.

| **[CAMEO: Autocorrelation-Preserving Line Simplification for Lossy Time Series Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14432v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from a variety of sensors and IoT devices need effective compression to reduce storage and I/O bandwidth requirements. While most time series databases and systems rely on lossless compression, lossy techniques offer even greater space-saving with a small loss in precision. However, the unknown impact on downstream analytics applications requires a semi-manual trial-and-error exploration. We initiate work on lossy compression that provides guarantees on complex statistical features (which are strongly correlated with the accuracy of the downstream analytics). Specifically, we propose a new lossy compression method that provides guarantees on the autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF) of a time series. Our method leverages line simplification techniques as well as incremental maintenance of aggregates, blocking, and parallelization strategies for effective and efficient compression. The results show that our method improves compression ratios by 2x on average and up to 54x on selected datasets, compared to previous lossy and lossless compression methods. Moreover, we maintain -- and sometimes even improve -- the forecasting accuracy by preserving the autocorrelation properties of the time series. Our framework is extensible to multivariate time series and other statistical features of the time series.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11430v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult.

| **[Reconstructing ecological community dynamics from limited observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03820v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ecosystems tend to fluctuate around stable equilibria in response to internal dynamics and environmental factors. Occasionally, they enter an unstable tipping region and collapse into an alternative stable state. Our understanding of how ecological communities vary over time and respond to perturbations depends on our ability to quantify and predict these dynamics. However, the scarcity of long, dense time series data poses a severe bottleneck for characterising community dynamics using existing methods. We overcome this limitation by combining information across multiple short time series using Bayesian inference. By decomposing dynamics into deterministic and stochastic components using Gaussian process priors, we predict stable and tipping regions along the community landscape and quantify resilience while addressing uncertainty. After validation with simulated and real ecological time series, we use the model to question common assumptions underlying classical potential analysis and re-evaluate the stability of previously proposed "tipping elements" in the human gut microbiota.</p></details> |  |

However, theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signals. In this contribution, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm and show that, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCAD: Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series from the Perspective of Granger Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13493v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series anomaly detection has numerous real-world applications and is being extensively studied. Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[FreEformer: Frequency Enhanced Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13989v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents \textbf{FreEformer}, a simple yet effective model that leverages a \textbf{Fre}quency \textbf{E}nhanced Trans\textbf{former} for multivariate time series forecasting. Our work is based on the assumption that the frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of series across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust representation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the complex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Transformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture cross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed independently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a low-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be attributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the strong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this, we enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional learnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1 normalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention mechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity, traffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention mechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art Transformer-based forecasters.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it stands to benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, certain critical architectural decisions have not received systematic exploration. In this study, we meticulously investigate these design choices within the broad category of encoder-predictor architectures. We identify robust architectures applicable to both time series and spectrogram input representations. These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version accepted by Computers in Biology and Medicine, code available at https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/s4sleep</p></details> |

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and evaluation of time series embedding methods for effective representations in machine learning and deep learning models. We introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their theoretical foundations and application contexts. Unlike previous surveys, our work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific applications, including engineering systems. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we provide an open-source code repository implementing these embedding methods. This study contributes to the field by offering a systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications, and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Dynamic Triple Gamma Prior as a Shrinkage Process Prior for Time-Varying Parameter Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10487v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing shrinkage approaches for time-varying parameter (TVP) models assume constant innovation variances across time points, inducing sparsity by shrinking these variances toward zero. However, this assumption falls short when states exhibit large jumps or structural changes, as often seen in empirical time series analysis. To address this, we propose the dynamic triple gamma prior -- a stochastic process that induces time-dependent shrinkage by modeling dependence among innovations while retaining a well-known triple gamma marginal distribution. This framework encompasses various special and limiting cases, including the horseshoe shrinkage prior, making it highly flexible. We derive key properties of the dynamic triple gamma that highlight its dynamic shrinkage behavior and develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling. The proposed approach is evaluated through sparse covariance modeling and forecasting of the returns of the EURO STOXX 50 index, demonstrating favorable forecasting performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach combines two trend estimation methods: the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter and the l1 filter. A major challenge in these methods is selecting the tuning parameter lambda, which we address by introducing two selection techniques. For the HP based change point detection, we propose a probability-based threshold to select lambda under the assumption of an exponential distribution. For the l1 based method, we suggest a selection strategy assuming normality. Additionally, we introduce a technique to estimate the maximum number of change points in time segments using the l1 based method. We validate our methods by comparing them to similar techniques, such as PELT, using simulated data. We also demonstrate the practical application of our approach to real-world SNP stock data, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting change points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Multi-Modal Subcomponent-Level Measurements for Trustworthy System Monitoring and Malware Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13081v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasingly sophisticated cyber-adversaries able to access a wider repertoire of mechanisms to implant malware such as ransomware, CPU/GPU keyloggers, and stealthy kernel rootkits, there is an urgent need for techniques to detect and mitigate such attacks. While state of the art relies on digital and analog side channel measurements assuming trustworthiness of measurements obtained on the main processor, such an approach has limitations since processor-based side channel measurements are potentially untrustworthy. Sophisticated adversaries (especially in late stage cyber attacks when they have breached the computer and network security systems such as firewalls and antivirus and penetrated the computer's OS) can compromise user-space and kernel-space measurements. To address this key limitation of state of the art, we propose a "subcomponent-level" approach to collect side channel measurements so as to enable robust anomaly detection in a modern computer even when the main processor is compromised. Our proposed approach leverages the fact that modern computers are complex systems with multiple interacting subcomponents and measurements from subcomponents can be used to detect anomalies even when the main processor is no longer trustworthy. We develop mechanisms to obtain time series measurements of activity of several subcomponents and methodologies to process and fuse these measurements for anomaly detection. The subcomponents include network interface controller, GPU, CPU Hardware Performance Counters, CPU power, and keyboard. Our main hypothesis is that subcomponent measurements can enable detection of security threats without requiring a trustworthy main processor. By enabling real-time measurements from multiple subcomponents, the goal is to provide a deeper visibility into system operation, thereby yielding a powerful tool to track system operation and detect anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 29 figures |

The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

| **[TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13041v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current time series forecasting methods can be broadly classified into two categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies, both aiming to capture the complex dependencies within time series data. However, the CI strategy fails to exploit highly correlated covariate information, while the CD strategy integrates all dependencies, including irrelevant or noisy ones, thus compromising generalization. To mitigate these issues, recent works have introduced the Channel Clustering (CC) strategy by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying different modeling techniques to each cluster. However, coarse-grained clustering cannot flexibly capture complex, time-varying interactions. Addressing the above challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a graph-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. Specifically, after constructing the graph with the input sequence, TimeFilter filters out irrelevant correlations and preserves the most critical ones through patch-specific filtering. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeFilter.</p></details> |  |

So far, causal research has been focused mostly on the i.i.d. setting. However, many are the situations where there exists a non-trivial dependence structure between sequential observations. Motivated by this fact, the main purpose of this work is to study causal properties of time series under the structural assumption of a VARMA model with instantaneous effects. First, the global Markov property is studied, building on existing work for VAR processes without instantaneous effects. Infinite graphs which represent the dependencies of the process are defined so that separation statements translate to conditional independencies in the stationary distribution of the process. Second, faithfulness is examined as a counterpart of this Markov property. Conditions are given so that the stationary distribution of the process is almost surely faithful to said infinite graphs. In addition, an instrumental variable regression framework is developed for VARMA models with instantaneous effects. This allows to identify and consistently estimate total causal effects.</p></details> | 42 pages, 9 figures |

Punctuation marks at the end of sentences are of particular importance as their distribution can determine various complexity features of written natural language. Here, the sentence length variability (SLV) time series representing "Hopscotch" by Julio Cortazar are subjected to quantitative analysis with an attempt to identify their distribution type, long-memory effects, and potential multiscale patterns. The analyzed novel is an important and innovative piece of literature whose essential property is freedom of movement between its building blocks given to a reader by the author. The statistical consequences of this freedom are closely investigated in both the original, Spanish version of the novel, and its translations into English and Polish. Clear evidence of rich multifractality in the SLV dynamics, with a left-sided asymmetry, however, is observed in all three language versions as well as in the versions with differently ordered chapters.</p></details> |  |

This work emphasizes the importance of integrating decentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However, decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success of such spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharing need to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis of the forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSO regression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics market to ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers and sellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporating price constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation. Results show significant accuracy improvements and potential monetary gains for data sellers. For wind power data, an average root mean squared error improvement of over 10% was achieved by comparing forecasts generated by the proposal with locally generated ones.</p></details> |  |

The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of future predictions of tumor masks and multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MRI) of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our approach is based on cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We included sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning inputs to guide the generative diffusion process as well as a joint segmentation process. This allows for tumor growth estimates and realistic MRI generation at any given treatment and time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model demonstrates promising performance across various tasks, including generating high-quality multi-parametric MRI with tumor masks, performing time-series tumor segmentations, and providing uncertainty estimates. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRI, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprints in IEEE-TMI, 14 pages</p></details> |

With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultralow-dimensionality reduction for identifying critical transitions by spatial-temporal PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12582v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial and temporal information within the original data space. Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-way Matrix Autoregressive Model with Thresholds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10272v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, matrix-valued time series data have attracted significant attention in the literature with the recognition of threshold nonlinearity representing a significant advance. However, given the fact that a matrix is a two-array structure, it is unfortunate, perhaps even unusual, for the threshold literature to focus on using the same threshold variable for the rows and the columns. In fact, evidence in economic, financial, environmental and other data shows advantages of allowing the possibilities of two different threshold variables (with possibly different threshold parameters for rows and columns), hence the need for a Two-way Matrix AutoRegressive model with Thresholds (2-MART). Naturally, two threshold variables pose new and perhaps even fierce challenges, which might be the reason behind the adoption of only one threshold variable in the literature up to now. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive methodology for the 2-MART model, by overcoming various challenges. Compared with existing models in the literature, the new model can achieve greater dimension reduction, much better model fitting, more accurate predictions, and more plausible interpretations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A causal learning approach to in-orbit inertial parameter estimation for multi-payload deployers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14824v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses an approach to inertial parameter estimation for the case of cargo carrying spacecraft that is based on causal learning, i.e. learning from the responses of the spacecraft, under actuation. Different spacecraft configurations (inertial parameter sets) are simulated under different actuation profiles, in order to produce an optimised time-series clustering classifier that can be used to distinguish between them. The actuation is comprised of finite sequences of constant inputs that are applied in order, based on typical actuators available. By learning from the system's responses across multiple input sequences, and then applying measures of time-series similarity and F1-score, an optimal actuation sequence can be chosen either for one specific system configuration or for the overall set of possible configurations. This allows for both estimation of the inertial parameter set without any prior knowledge of state, as well as validation of transitions between different configurations after a deployment event. The optimisation of the actuation sequence is handled by a reinforcement learning model that uses the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm, by repeatedly trying different sequences and evaluating the impact on classifier performance according to a multi-objective metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 18 figures, 1 table.

The core research problem is developing an effective computer vision-based model using raw candlestick visuals without time-series data. We specifically analyze the impact of incorporating candlestick patterns that were detected by YOLOv8. The study implements two approaches: pure CNN on chart images and a Decomposer architecture detecting patterns. Experiments utilize diverse financial datasets spanning stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex assets. Key findings demonstrate candlestick patterns do not improve model performance over only image data in our research. The significance is illuminating limitations in candlestick image signals. Performance peaked at approximately 0.7 accuracy, below more complex time-series models. Outcomes reveal challenges in distilling sufficient predictive power from visual shapes alone, motivating the incorporation of other data modalities. This research clarifies how purely image-based models can inform trading while confirming patterns add little value over raw charts. Our content is endeavored to be delineated into distinct sections, each autonomously furnishing a unique contribution while maintaining cohesive linkage. Note that, the examples discussed herein are not limited to the scope, applicability, or knowledge outlined in the paper.</p></details> | ACMLC 2025; 8 pages |
| **[Automatic selection of the best neural architecture for time series forecasting via multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12215v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, including weather prediction, healthcare, structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy systems, and financial markets. While models such as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have become standard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains a challenge. Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and the datasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal model controversial. In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework for time series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diverse network architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSM blocks. Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determines the number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specific requirements and evaluation objectives. From the resulting Pareto-optimal architectures, the best model for a given context is selected via a user-defined preference function. We validate our framework across four distinct real-world applications. Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTM is usually optimal when minimizing training time alone. However, when maximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architectures are often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specific configurations. By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolve trade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimal architectures. Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture is universally optimal for time series forecasting. Instead, the best-performing model emerges as a data-driven composite architecture tailored to user-defined criteria and evaluation objectives.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the S&P 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning Systems for Time-Series Power Consumption Prediction with Multi-Head Embedding Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12136v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction is increasingly popular in a variety of applications, such as smart factories and smart transportation. Researchers have used various techniques to predict power consumption, but existing models lack discussion of collaborative learning and privacy issues among multiple clients. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Head Heterogeneous Federated Learning (MHHFL) systems that consist of multiple head networks, which independently act as carriers for federated learning. In the federated period, each head network is embedded into 2-dimensional vectors and shared with the centralized source pool. MHHFL then selects appropriate source networks and blends the head networks as knowledge transfer in federated learning. The experimental results show that the proposed MHHFL systems significantly outperform the benchmark and state-of-the-art systems and reduce the prediction error by 24.9% to 94.1%. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in the MHHFL (head network embedding and selection mechanisms), which significantly outperforms traditional federated average and random transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning System for Sparse Healthcare Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12125v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) system for sparse time series prediction in healthcare, which is a decentralized federated learning algorithm with heterogeneous transfers. We design dense and sparse feature tensors to deal with the sparsity of data sources. Heterogeneous federated learning is developed to share asynchronous parts of networks and select appropriate models for knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that the proposed HFL achieves the lowest prediction error among all benchmark systems on eight out of ten prediction tasks, with MSE reduction of 94.8%, 48.3%, and 52.1% compared to the benchmark systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HFL in transferring knowledge from heterogeneous domains, especially in the smaller target domain. Ablation studies then demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed mechanisms for heterogeneous domain selection and switching in predicting healthcare time series with privacy, model security, and heterogeneous knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise-Resilient Point-wise Anomaly Detection in Time Series Using Weak Segment Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11959v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in temporal data has gained significant attention across various real-world applications, aiming to identify unusual events and mitigate potential hazards. In practice, situations often involve a mix of segment-level labels (detected abnormal events with segments of time points) and unlabeled data (undetected events), while the ideal algorithmic outcome should be point-level predictions. Therefore, the huge label information gap between training data and targets makes the task challenging. In this study, we formulate the above imperfect information as noisy labels and propose NRdetector, a noise-resilient framework that incorporates confidence-based sample selection, robust segment-level learning, and data-centric point-level detection for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Particularly, to bridge the information gap between noisy segment-level labels and missing point-level labels, we develop a novel loss function that can effectively mitigate the label noise and consider the temporal features. It encourages the smoothness of consecutive points and the separability of points from segments with different labels. Extensive experiments on real-world multivariate time series datasets with 11 different evaluation metrics demonstrate that NRdetector consistently achieves robust results across multiple real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines adapted to operate in our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'25)</p></details> |

| **[Scenarios Generation-based Multiple Interval Prediction Method for Electricity Prices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08532v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an innovative interval prediction methodology aimed at addressing the limitations of current evaluation indicators while enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability. To achieve this, new evaluation metrics are proposed, offering a comprehensive assessment of interval prediction methods across both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Additionally, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic scenarios and support a new interval prediction framework based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model incorporates unique modifications to random noise inputs, enabling the creation of pattern-diverse and realistic scenarios. These scenarios are then utilized to produce multiple interval patterns characterized by high coverage probability and reduced average width. The proposed approach is validated through detailed case studies, and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions to further refine interval prediction techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Vibration Forecasting for Advancing Rail Safety and Maintenance 4.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11730v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining railway axles is critical to preventing severe accidents and financial losses. The railway industry is increasingly interested in advanced condition monitoring techniques to enhance safety and efficiency, moving beyond traditional periodic inspections toward Maintenance 4.0. This study introduces a robust Deep Autoregressive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems to avert mechanical failures. Our approach simulates and predicts vibration signals under various conditions and fault scenarios, improving dataset robustness for more effective detection systems. These systems can alert maintenance needs, preventing accidents preemptively. We use experimental vibration signals from accelerometers on train axles. Our primary contributions include a transformer model, ShaftFormer, designed for processing time series data, and an alternative model incorporating spectral methods and enhanced observation models. Simulating vibration signals under diverse conditions mitigates the high cost of obtaining experimental signals for all scenarios. Given the non-stationary nature of railway vibration signals, influenced by speed and load changes, our models address these complexities, offering a powerful tool for predictive maintenance in the rail industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the performance of the Phase II Hotelling T2 chart when monitoring multivariate time series observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11649v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks to high-tech measurement systems like sensors, data are often collected with high frequency in modern industrial processes. This phenomenon could potentially produce autocorrelated and cross-correlated measurements. It has been shown that if this issue is not properly accounted for while designing the control charts, many false alarms may be observed, disrupting the monitoring process efficiency. There are generally two recommended ways to monitor autocorrelated data: fitting a time series model and then monitoring the residuals or directly monitoring the original observations. Although residual charts are popular in the literature because they offer advantages such as ease of implementation, questions have been raised about their efficiency due to the loss of information. This paper develops the methodology for applying Hotelling's T2 chart directly to monitoring multivariate autocorrelated and cross-correlated observations. To model such data, we use the multivariate vector autoregressive time series model of order p >= 1, denoted as VAR(p). We compare the performance of the T2 chart based on the original observations and the residual-based T2 chart using the well-known metric average run length and a newly introduced criterion called first-to-signal. The results indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the alternative chart. We also illustrate the proposed method using two examples: one from a steel sheet rolling process (VAR(1) observations) and another from a chemical process (VAR(3) observations).</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Network Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17779v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations (N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by interactions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the interplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics (\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\emph{network effect}), and a \emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion. Our primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from high-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model lies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct scenarios: \textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified, and we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified, considering the linear growth of the parameter space with the number of edges. \textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the data. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso, tailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the network graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in causal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic systems. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of our estimators across various graph topologies in high-dimensional settings. We also showcase the framework's applicability to real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing the analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using dynamic loss weighting to boost improvements in forecast stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18267v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rolling origin forecast instability refers to variability in forecasts for a specific period induced by updating the forecast when new data points become available. Recently, an extension to the N-BEATS model for univariate time series point forecasting was proposed to include forecast stability as an additional optimization objective, next to accuracy. It was shown that more stable forecasts can be obtained without harming accuracy by minimizing a composite loss function that contains both a forecast error and a forecast instability component, with a static hyperparameter to control the impact of stability. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether further improvements in stability can be obtained without compromising accuracy by applying dynamic loss weighting algorithms, which change the loss weights during training. We show that existing dynamic loss weighting methods can achieve this objective and provide insights into why this might be the case. Additionally, we propose an extension to the Random Weighting approach -- Task-Aware Random Weighting -- which also achieves this objective.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLinear-based Prediction of Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-Ion Batteries: Feature Engineering through Explainable Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11542v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is essential for ensuring safety, reducing maintenance costs, and optimizing usage. However, predicting RUL is challenging due to the nonlinear characteristics of the degradation caused by complex chemical reactions. Machine learning allows precise predictions by learning the latent functions of degradation relationships based on cycling behavior. This study introduces an accurate RUL prediction approach based on feature engineering and DLinear, applied to the dataset from NASA's Prognostics Center of Excellence. Among the 20 features generated from current, voltage, temperature, and time provided in this dataset, key features contributing to degradation are selected using Pearson correlation coefficient and Shapley values. Shapley value-based feature selection effectively reflects cell-to-cell variability, showing similar importance rankings across all cells. The DLinear-based RUL prediction using key features efficiently captures the time-series trend, demonstrating significantly better performance compared to Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

The obtained results, for 5 different datasets, show that the new representation, computed using the tsfresh library, allows Isolation Forest to significantly improve its performance.</p></details> | 7 |
| **[A Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model for Hydrological Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00453v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical models are an essential tool to model, forecast and understand the hydrological processes in watersheds. In particular, the understanding of time lags associated with the delay between rainfall occurrence and subsequent changes in streamflow is of high practical importance. Since water can take a variety of flow paths to generate streamflow, a series of distinct runoff pulses may combine to create the observed streamflow time series. Current state-of-the-art models are not able to sufficiently confront the problem complexity with interpretable parametrization, thus preventing novel insights about the dynamics of distinct flow paths from being formed. The proposed Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model targets this problem by combining the concept of multiple windows sliding along the time axis with multiple linear regression. The window kernels, which indicate the weights applied to different time lags, are implemented via Gaussian-shaped kernels. As a result, straightforward process inference can be achieved since each window can represent one flow path. Experiments on simulated and real-world scenarios underline that the proposed model achieves accurate parameter estimates and competitive predictive performance, while fostering explainable and interpretable hydrological modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[An accuracy-runtime trade-off comparison of scalable Gaussian process approximations for spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11448v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely employed in various fields such as spatial statistics, time series analysis, and machine learning. A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost having $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity which makes them prohibitive for large datasets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations concerning marginal likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction taking into account the time required to achieve a certain accuracy. We analyze this trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world datasets and find that Vecchia approximations consistently emerge as the most accurate in almost all experiments. However, for certain real-world data sets, low-rank inducing point-based methods, i.e., full-scale and modified predictive process approximations, can provide more accurate predictive distributions for extrapolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, regular paper</p></details> |
| **[On the Dimension of Pullback Attractors in Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11357v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive parameters identification for nonlinear dynamics using deep permutation invariant networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11350v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising outcomes of dynamical system identification techniques, such as SINDy [Brunton et al. 2016], highlight their advantages in providing qualitative interpretability and extrapolation compared to non-interpretable deep neural networks [Rudin 2019]. These techniques suffer from parameter updating in real-time use cases, especially when the system parameters are likely to change during or between processes. Recently, the OASIS [Bhadriraju et al. 2020] framework introduced a data-driven technique to address the limitations of real-time dynamical system parameters updating, yielding interesting results. Nevertheless, we show in this work that superior performance can be achieved using more advanced model architectures. We present an innovative encoding approach, based mainly on the use of Set Encoding methods of sequence data, which give accurate adaptive model identification for complex dynamic systems, with variable input time series length. Two Set Encoding methods are used, the first is Deep Set [Zaheer et al. 2017], and the second is Set Transformer [Lee et al. 2019]. Comparing Set Transformer to OASIS framework on Lotka Volterra for real-time local dynamical system identification and time series forecasting, we find that the Set Transformer architecture is well adapted to learning relationships within data sets. We then compare the two Set Encoding methods based on the Lorenz system for online global dynamical system identification. Finally, we trained a Deep Set model to perform identification and characterization of abnormalities for 1D heat-transfer problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-dimensional point forecast combinations for emergency department demand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11315v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current work on forecasting emergency department (ED) admissions focuses on disease aggregates or singular disease types. However, given differences in the dynamics of individual diseases, it is unlikely that any single forecasting model would accurately account for each disease and for all time, leading to significant forecast model uncertainty. Yet, forecasting models for ED admissions to-date do not explore the utility of forecast combinations to improve forecast accuracy and stability. It is also unknown whether improvements in forecast accuracy can be yield from (1) incorporating a large number of environmental and anthropogenic covariates or (2) forecasting total ED causes by aggregating cause-specific ED forecasts. To address this gap, we propose high-dimensional forecast combination schemes to combine a large number of forecasting individual models for forecasting cause-specific ED admissions over multiple causes and forecast horizons. We use time series data of ED admissions with an extensive set of explanatory lagged variables at the national level, including meteorological/ambient air pollutant variables and ED admissions of all 16 causes studied. We show that the simple forecast combinations yield forecast accuracies of around 3.81%-23.54% across causes. Furthermore, forecast combinations outperform individual forecasting models, in more than 50% of scenarios (across all ED admission categories and horizons) in a statistically significant manner. Inclusion of high-dimensional covariates and aggregating cause-specific forecasts to provide all-cause ED forecasts provided modest improvements in forecast accuracy. Forecasting cause-specific ED admissions can provide fine-scale forward guidance on resource optimization and pandemic preparedness and forecast combinations can be used to hedge against model uncertainty when forecasting across a wide range of admission categories.</p></details> |  |

We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability. We discuss possible reasons for this surprising finding and draw conclusions about the design and test of trajectory prediction models and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.13431</p></details> |

We propose a novel approach, Trajectory Encoding Augmentation (TEA), which extends the state space by integrating latent representations of environmental dynamics obtained from sequence encoders, such as AutoEncoders. Our findings show that incorporating these encodings with TEA improves the transferability of a single policy to novel environments with new dynamics, surpassing methods that rely solely on unmodified states. These results indicate that TEA captures critical, environment-specific characteristics, enabling RL agents to generalize effectively across dynamic conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ESANN 2025</p></details> |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05585v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory optimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations. This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Where Do You Go? Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning segmentation from point trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |

A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization.

| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |

Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

| **[Towards Generalizable Trajectory Prediction Using Dual-Level Representation Learning And Adaptive Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04815v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vehicle trajectory prediction models struggle with generalizability, prediction uncertainties, and handling complex interactions. It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

However, controlling the trajectory of nonlinear models with system uncertainties remains a critical challenge, often leading to reduced accuracy and reliability. To address this, the study develops an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) integrated with Neural Networks (NNs) to improve trajectory tracking for cylindrical manipulators. The ASMC leverages the robustness of sliding mode control and the adaptability of neural networks to handle uncertainties and dynamic variations effectively. Simulation results validate that the proposed ASMC-NN achieves high trajectory tracking accuracy, fast response time, and enhanced reliability, making it a promising solution for applications in 3D printing and beyond.</p></details> |  |

| **[Motion Manifold Flow Primitives for Task-Conditioned Trajectory Generation under Complex Task-Motion Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19681v3)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective movement primitives should be capable of encoding and generating a rich repertoire of trajectories -- typically collected from human demonstrations -- conditioned on task-defining parameters such as vision or language inputs. While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Future Success Prediction in Open-Vocabulary Object Manipulation Tasks Based on End-Effector Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19112v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study addresses a task designed to predict the future success or failure of open-vocabulary object manipulation. In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method. The experimental results show that our method achieved a higher prediction accuracy than baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at LangRob @ CoRL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Frenet-Serret-Based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04273v1)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial element of guidance, navigation, and control systems. This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively. We demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels through extensive experimentation, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem. In addition, positive results are obtained using minimal information.</p></details> | Sensors 2020 |

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Multi-Agent Framework with Trajectory Learning for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09893v3)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in various natural language processing tasks. However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00915v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>AIAA ...</summary><p>AIAA SCITECH 2025 Forum</p></details> |

Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectories of Change: Approaches for Tracking Knowledge Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00391v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 23 figures, initial content of this paper appears in Paper 23-352 at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, August 13-17 2023</p></details> |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, the vast bandwidths available also make the impact of beam squint in massive multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) systems non-negligible. Traditional approaches such as adding a true-time-delay line (TTD) on each antenna are costly due to the massive antenna arrays required. This paper puts forth a signal processing alternative, specifically adapted to the multicarrier structure of OFDM systems, through an innovative application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to optimize hybrid beamforming. By integrating two types of graph nodes to represent the analog and the digital beamforming matrices efficiently, our approach not only reduces the computational and memory burdens but also achieves high spectral efficiency performance, approaching that of all digital beamforming. The GNN runtime and memory requirement are at a fraction of the processing time and resource consumption of traditional signal processing methods, hence enabling real-time adaptation of hybrid beamforming. Furthermore, the proposed GNN exhibits strong resiliency to beam squinting, achieving almost constant spectral efficiency even as the system bandwidth increases at higher carrier frequencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

Recently, the principal odor map (POM) was introduced to digitize the olfactory properties of single compounds. However, smells in real life are not pure single molecules, but complex mixtures of molecules, whose representations remain relatively under-explored. In this work, we introduce POMMix, an extension of the POM to represent mixtures. Our representation builds upon the symmetries of the problem space in a hierarchical manner: (1) graph neural networks for building molecular embeddings, (2) attention mechanisms for aggregating molecular representations into mixture representations, and (3) cosine prediction heads to encode olfactory perceptual distance in the mixture embedding space. POMMix achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance across multiple datasets. We also evaluate the generalizability of the representation on multiple splits when applied to unseen molecules and mixture sizes. Our work advances the effort to digitize olfaction, and highlights the synergy of domain expertise and deep learning in crafting expressive representations in low-data regimes.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

A major bottleneck in Gaussian elimination for these systems is fill-in, the creation of non-zero entries that increase memory and computational cost. Minimizing fill-in is NP-hard, and existing heuristics like Minimum Degree and Nested Dissection offer limited adaptability across diverse problem instances. We introduce \textit{ReFill}, a reinforcement learning framework enhanced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn adaptive ordering strategies for fill-in minimization. ReFill trains a GNN-based heuristic to predict efficient elimination orders, outperforming traditional heuristics by dynamically adapting to the structure of input matrices. Experiments demonstrate that ReFill outperforms strong heuristics in reducing fill-in, highlighting the untapped potential of learning-based methods for this well-studied classical problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaDyG:A New Paradigm for Large-scale Dynamic Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16002v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs (DGs), which capture time-evolving relationships between graph entities, have widespread real-world applications. To efficiently encode DGs for downstream tasks, most dynamic graph neural networks follow the traditional message-passing mechanism and extend it with time-based techniques. Despite their effectiveness, the growth of historical interactions introduces significant scalability issues, particularly in industry scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose ScaDyG, with the core idea of designing a time-aware scalable learning paradigm as follows: 1) Time-aware Topology Reformulation: ScaDyG first segments historical interactions into time steps (intra and inter) based on dynamic modeling, enabling weight-free and time-aware graph propagation within pre-processing. 2) Dynamic Temporal Encoding: To further achieve fine-grained graph propagation within time steps, ScaDyG integrates temporal encoding through a combination of exponential functions in a scalable manner. 3) Hypernetwork-driven Message Aggregation: After obtaining the propagated features (i.e., messages), ScaDyG utilizes hypernetwork to analyze historical dependencies, implementing node-wise representation by an adaptive temporal fusion. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that ScaDyG performs comparably well or even outperforms other SOTA methods in both node and link-level downstream tasks, with fewer learnable parameters and higher efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-View Attention Syntactic Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15968v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is the task aimed at predicting the sentiment polarity of aspect words within sentences. Recently, incorporating graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture additional syntactic structure information in the dependency tree derived from syntactic dependency parsing has been proven to be an effective paradigm for boosting ABSA. Despite GNNs enhancing model capability by fusing more types of information, most works only utilize a single topology view of the dependency tree or simply conflate different perspectives of information without distinction, which limits the model performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a new multi-view attention syntactic enhanced graph convolutional network (MASGCN) that weighs different syntactic information of views using attention mechanisms. Specifically, we first construct distance mask matrices from the dependency tree to obtain multiple subgraph views for GNNs. To aggregate features from different views, we propose a multi-view attention mechanism to calculate the attention weights of views. Furthermore, to incorporate more syntactic information, we fuse the dependency type information matrix into the adjacency matrices and present a structural entropy loss to learn the dependency type adjacency matrix. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

To address these challenges, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as an innovative solution. GC focuses on synthesizing a compact yet highly representative graph, enabling GNNs trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large graph. The notable efficacy of GC and its broad prospects have garnered significant attention and spurred extensive research. This survey paper provides an up-to-date and systematic overview of GC, organizing existing research into five categories aligned with critical GC evaluation criteria: effectiveness, generalization, efficiency, fairness, and robustness. To facilitate an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of GC, this paper examines various methods under each category and thoroughly discusses two essential components within GC: optimization strategies and condensed graph generation. We also empirically compare and analyze representative GC methods with diverse optimization strategies based on the five proposed GC evaluation criteria. Finally, we explore the applications of GC in various fields, outline the related open-source libraries, and highlight the present challenges and novel insights, with the aim of promoting advancements in future research.

They exhibit high data efficiency during training and significantly reduced inference time for interatomic potential calculations compared to classical approaches. Key to these models is the Clebsch-Gordon (CG) tensor product, a kernel that contracts two dense feature vectors with a highly structured sparse tensor to produce a dense output vector. The operation, which may be repeated millions of times for typical equivariant models, is a costly and inefficient bottleneck. We introduce a GPU sparse kernel generator for the CG tensor product that provides significant speedup over the best existing open and closed-source implementations. Our implementation achieves high performance by carefully managing GPU shared memory through static analysis at model compile-time, minimizing reads and writes to global memory. We break the tensor product into a series of kernels with operands that fit entirely into registers, enabling us to emit long arithmetic instruction streams that maximize instruction-level parallelism. By fusing the CG tensor product with a subsequent graph convolution, we reduce both intermediate storage and global memory traffic over naive approaches that duplicate input data. We also provide optimized kernels for the gradient of the CG tensor product and a novel identity for the higher partial derivatives required to predict interatomic forces. Our fused kernels offer up to 4.5x speedup for the forward pass and 3x for the backward pass over NVIDIA cuEquivariance, as well as >10x speedup over the widely-used e3nn package. We offer up to 5.3x inference-time speedup for the MACE chemistry foundation model over the original unoptimized version.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive AI-based Decentralized Resource Management in the Cloud-Edge Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15802v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of application requirements and the dynamic nature of the Cloud-Edge Continuum present significant challenges for efficient resource management. These challenges stem from the ever-changing infrastructure, which is characterized by additions, removals, and reconfigurations of nodes and links, as well as the variability of application workloads. Traditional centralized approaches struggle to adapt to these changes due to their static nature, while decentralized solutions face challenges such as limited global visibility and coordination overhead. This paper proposes a hybrid decentralized framework for dynamic application placement and resource management. The framework utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to embed resource and application states, enabling comprehensive representation and efficient decision-making. It employs a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, where local agents optimize resource management in their neighborhoods and a global orchestrator ensures system-wide coordination. By combining decentralized application placement with centralized oversight, our framework addresses the scalability, adaptability, and accuracy challenges inherent in the Cloud-Edge Continuum. This work contributes to the development of decentralized application placement strategies, the integration of GNN embeddings, and collaborative MARL systems, providing a foundation for efficient, adaptive and scalable resource management.</p></details> |  |

While research has largely focused on developing specialized graph LLMs through task-specific instruction tuning, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs solely through prompt design remains surprisingly absent. Without such a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, tailored graph LLMs are compared against general LLMs using simplistic queries (e.g., zero-shot reasoning with LLaMA), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well as unexpected predicaments of them. To achieve more general evaluations and unveil the true potential of LLMs for graph tasks, we introduce Graph In-context Learning (GraphICL) Benchmark, a comprehensive benchmark comprising novel prompt templates designed to capture graph structure and handle limited label knowledge. Our systematic evaluation shows that general-purpose LLMs equipped with our GraphICL outperform state-of-the-art specialized graph LLMs and graph neural network models in resource-constrained settings and out-of-domain tasks. These findings highlight the significant potential of prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance on graph learning tasks without training and offer a strong baseline for advancing research in graph LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recent technology advances, such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are able to collect high-resolution trajectory data, which enables trajectory-based risk analysis. This study investigates a new vehicle group (VG) based risk analysis method and explores risk evolution mechanisms considering VG features. An impact-based vehicle grouping method is proposed to cluster vehicles into VGs by evaluating their responses to the erratic behaviors of nearby vehicles. The risk of a VG is aggregated based on the risk between each vehicle pair in the VG, measured by inverse Time-to-Collision (iTTC). A Logistic Regression and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) are then employed to predict VG risks using aggregated and disaggregated VG information. Both methods achieve excellent performance with AUC values exceeding 0.93. For the GNN model, GNNExplainer with feature perturbation is applied to identify critical individual vehicle features and their directional impact on VG risks. Overall, this research contributes a new perspective for identifying, predicting, and interpreting traffic risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures; vehicle grouping method updated, explainable GNN framework incorporated</p></details> |

Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In particular, de Santi et al. (2023) developed models that could accurately infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from catalogs that only contain the positions and radial velocities of galaxies that are robust to uncertainties in astrophysics and subgrid models. However, observations are affected by many effects, including 1) masking, 2) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and 3) different galaxy selections. Moreover, observations only allow us to measure redshift, intertwining galaxies' radial positions and velocities. In this paper we train and test our models on galaxy catalogs, created from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes from the CAMELS project, that incorporate these observational effects. We find that, although the presence of these effects degrades the precision and accuracy of the models, and increases the fraction of catalogs where the model breaks down, the fraction of galaxy catalogs where the model performs well is over 90 %, demonstrating the potential of these models to constrain cosmological parameters even when applied to real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Distributionally Robust Graph Out-of-Distribution Recommendation via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15555v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based graph neural network methods improve recommendation systems' out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization by optimizing the model's worst-case performance. However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by WWW'25</p></details> |

However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by WWW2025</p></details> |

However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the model depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a single value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent limitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of information from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a novel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba paradigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new backbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation Layer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State Prediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate neighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for deep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing methods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates the effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation learning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Existing methods utilize these aspects to model users' fine-grained preferences for specific item features through graph neural networks. We argue that the performance of items on different aspects is important for making precise recommendations, which has not been taken into account by existing approaches, due to lack of data. In this paper, we propose an aspect performance-aware hypergraph neural network (APH) for the review-based recommendation, which learns the performance of items from the conflicting sentiment polarity of user reviews. Specifically, APH comprehensively models the relationships among users, items, aspects, and sentiment polarity by systematically constructing an aspect hypergraph based on user reviews. In addition, APH aggregates aspects representing users and items by employing an aspect performance-aware hypergraph aggregation method. It aggregates the sentiment polarities from multiple users by jointly considering user preferences and the semantics of their sentiments, determining the weights of sentiment polarities to infer the performance of items on various aspects. Such performances are then used as weights to aggregate neighboring aspects. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that APH improves MSE, Precision@5, and Recall@5 by an average of 2.30%, 4.89%, and 1.60% over the best baseline.

Existing fair graph learning typically favors pairwise constraints to achieve fairness but fails to cast off dimensional limitations and generalize them into multiple sensitive attributes; besides, most studies focus on in-processing techniques to enforce and calibrate fairness, constructing a model-agnostic debiasing GNN framework at the pre-processing stage to prevent downstream misuses and improve training reliability is still largely under-explored. Furthermore, previous work on GNNs tend to enhance either fairness or privacy individually but few probe into their interplays. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic debiasing framework named MAPPING (\underline{M}asking \underline{A}nd \underline{P}runing and Message-\underline{P}assing train\underline{ING}) for fair node classification, in which we adopt the distance covariance($dCov$)-based fairness constraints to simultaneously reduce feature and topology biases in arbitrary dimensions, and combine them with adversarial debiasing to confine the risks of attribute inference attacks. Experiments on real-world datasets with different GNN variants demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MAPPING. Our results show that MAPPING can achieve better trade-offs between utility and fairness, and mitigate privacy risks of sensitive information leakage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW Journal.

| **[ReInc: Scaling Training of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15348v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) have gained widespread attention due to their applicability in diverse domains such as traffic network prediction, epidemiological forecasting, and social network analysis. In this paper, we present ReInc, a system designed to enable efficient and scalable training of DGNNs on large-scale graphs. ReInc introduces key innovations that capitalize on the unique combination of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) inherent in DGNNs. By reusing intermediate results and incrementally computing aggregations across consecutive graph snapshots, ReInc significantly enhances computational efficiency. To support these optimizations, ReInc incorporates a novel two-level caching mechanism with a specialized caching policy aligned to the DGNN execution workflow. Additionally, ReInc addresses the challenges of managing structural and temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs through a new distributed training strategy. This approach eliminates communication overheads associated with accessing remote features and redistributing intermediate results. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInc achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, tested across various dynamic GNN architectures and real-world graph datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15085v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Accurate prediction of these future interactions can enhance adaptive monitoring, enabling proactive maintenance and resolution of potential performance issues before they escalate. This study introduces a Graph Neural Network GNN based approach, specifically using a Graph Attention Network GAT, for link prediction in microservice Call Graphs. Unlike social networks, where interactions tend to occur sporadically and are often less frequent, microservice Call Graphs involve highly frequent and time sensitive interactions that are essential to operational performance. Our approach leverages temporal segmentation, advanced negative sampling, and GATs attention mechanisms to model these complex interactions accurately. Using real world data, we evaluate our model across performance metrics such as AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, demonstrating its high accuracy and robustness in predicting microservice interactions. Our findings support the potential of GNNs for proactive monitoring in distributed systems, paving the way for applications in adaptive resource management and performance optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation and publication at the ICPE 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Personalized Layer Selection for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14964v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine node attributes over a fixed granularity of the local graph structure around a node to predict its label. However, different nodes may relate to a node-level property with a different granularity of its local neighborhood, and using the same level of smoothing for all nodes can be detrimental to their classification. In this work, we challenge the common fact that a single GNN layer can classify all nodes of a graph by training GNNs with a distinct personalized layer for each node. Inspired by metric learning, we propose a novel algorithm, MetSelect1, to select the optimal representation layer to classify each node. In particular, we identify a prototype representation of each class in a transformed GNN layer and then, classify using the layer where the distance is smallest to a class prototype after normalizing with that layer's variance. Results on 10 datasets and 3 different GNNs show that we significantly improve the node classification accuracy of GNNs in a plug-and-play manner. We also find that using variable layers for prediction enables GNNs to be deeper and more robust to poisoning attacks. We hope this work can inspire future works to learn more adaptive and personalized graph representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[FIT-GNN: Faster Inference Time for GNNs Using Coarsening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15001v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large-scale graphs. To tackle this, coarsening-based methods are used to reduce the graph into a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during both training and inference phases. We demonstrate two different methods (Extra-Nodes and Cluster-Nodes). Our study also proposes a unique application of the coarsening algorithm for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression, which have not yet been explored. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets in the order of $100K$ nodes to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in tasks involving classification and regression on nodes and graphs, compared to traditional GNNs, while having single-node inference times that are orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, our approach significantly reduces memory consumption, allowing training and inference on low-resource devices where traditional methods struggle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this article, we take this field further by introducing novel architectural modifications compatible with a wide array of Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. Our approach advocates for integrating capsule layers, replacing the conventional decoding blocks in standard GNNs. These capsules are a group of neurons with vector activations. The orientation of these vectors represents important properties of the objects under study, with their magnitude characterizing whether the object under study belongs to the class represented by the capsule. Moreover, capsule networks incorporate a regularization by reconstruction mechanism, facilitating the seamless integration of expert-designed high-level features into the analysis. We have studied the usefulness of our architecture with the LorentzNet architecture for quark-gluon tagging. Here, we have replaced the decoding block of LorentzNet with a capsulated decoding block and have called the resulting architecture CapsLorentzNet. Our new architecture can enhance the performance of LorentzNet by 20 \% for the quark-gluon tagging task.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[An Attentive Graph Agent for Topology-Adaptive Cyber Defence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14700v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, reinforcement learning is emerging as a promising technique to create intelligent, self-improving defensive systems. However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information. To address this gap, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment that encodes the observable network state as a directed graph, utilizing realistic and interpretable low-level features. %, like number of open ports and unexpected detected connections. We leverage a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and modify its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning. GAT policies offer several advantages over standard approaches based on simplistic flattened state observations. They can handle the changes in network topology that occur at runtime when dynamic connections between hosts appear. Policies can be deployed to networks that differ in size to the ones seen during training, enabling a degree of generalisation inaccessible with alternative approaches. Furthermore, the graph neural network policies outputs are explainable in terms of tangible network properties, providing enhanced interpretability of defensive actions. We verify that our low-level graph observations are meaningful enough to train GAT defensive policies that are able to adapt to changing topologies. We evaluate how our trained policies perform when deployed on networks of varying sizes with the same subnetwork structure, comparing them against policies specifically trained for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Homophily of Heterogeneous Graphs: Understanding and Unleashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14600v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to connect, is a fundamental phenomenon in network science and a critical factor in the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). While existing studies primarily explore homophily in homogeneous graphs, where nodes share the same type, real-world networks are often more accurately modeled as heterogeneous graphs (HGs) with diverse node types and intricate cross-type interactions. This structural diversity complicates the analysis of homophily, as traditional homophily metrics fail to account for distinct label spaces across node types. To address this limitation, we introduce the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio, a novel metric that quantifies homophily based on the similarity of target information across different node types. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-Type Homophily-guided Heterogeneous Graph Pruning, a method designed to selectively remove low-homophily crosstype edges, thereby enhancing the Cross-Type Homophily Ratio and boosting the performance of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). Extensive experiments on five real-world HG datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, which delivers up to 13.36% average relative performance improvement for HGNNs, offering a fresh perspective on cross-type homophily in heterogeneous graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Condensation for Large-scale Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12231v3)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph condensation has emerged as an intriguing technique to save the expensive training costs of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by substituting a condensed small graph with the original graph. Despite the promising results achieved, previous methods usually employ an entangled paradigm of redundant parameters (nodes, edges, GNNs), which incurs complex joint optimization during condensation. This paradigm has considerably impeded the scalability of graph condensation, making it challenging to condense extremely large-scale graphs and generate high-fidelity condensed graphs. Therefore, we propose to disentangle the condensation process into a two-stage GNN-free paradigm, independently condensing nodes and generating edges while eliminating the need to optimize GNNs at the same time. The node condensation module avoids the complexity of GNNs by focusing on node feature alignment with anchors of the original graph, while the edge translation module constructs the edges of the condensed nodes by transferring the original structure knowledge with neighborhood anchors. This simple yet effective approach achieves at least 10 times faster than state-of-the-art methods with comparable accuracy on medium-scale graphs. Moreover, the proposed DisCo can successfully scale up to the Ogbn-papers100M graph containing over 100 million nodes with flexible reduction rates and improves performance on the second-largest Ogbn-products dataset by over 5%. Extensive downstream tasks and ablation study on five common datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DisCo framework.

| **[Backdoor Attack on Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11290v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Graph Neural Network (FedGNN) integrate federated learning (FL) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enable privacy-preserving training on distributed graph data. Vertical Federated Graph Neural Network (VFGNN), a key branch of FedGNN, handles scenarios where data features and labels are distributed among participants. Despite the robust privacy-preserving design of VFGNN, we have found that it still faces the risk of backdoor attacks, even in situations where labels are inaccessible. This paper proposes BVG, a novel backdoor attack method that leverages multi-hop triggers and backdoor retention, requiring only four target-class nodes to execute effective attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that BVG achieves nearly 100% attack success rates across three commonly used datasets and three GNN models, with minimal impact on the main task accuracy. We also evaluated various defense methods, and the BVG method maintained high attack effectiveness even under existing defenses. This finding highlights the need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter sophisticated backdoor attacks in practical VFGNN applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial Selection in Spectral Graph Neural Networks: An Error-Sum of Function Slices Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15354v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral graph neural networks are proposed to harness spectral information inherent in graph-structured data through the application of polynomial-defined graph filters, recently achieving notable success in graph-based web applications. Existing studies reveal that various polynomial choices greatly impact spectral GNN performance, underscoring the importance of polynomial selection. However, this selection process remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Although prior work suggests a connection between the approximation capabilities of polynomials and the efficacy of spectral GNNs, there is a lack of theoretical insights into this relationship, rendering polynomial selection a largely heuristic process. To address the issue, this paper examines polynomial selection from an error-sum of function slices perspective. Inspired by the conventional signal decomposition, we represent graph filters as a sum of disjoint function slices. Building on this, we then bridge the polynomial capability and spectral GNN efficacy by proving that the construction error of graph convolution layer is bounded by the sum of polynomial approximation errors on function slices. This result leads us to develop an advanced filter based on trigonometric polynomials, a widely adopted option for approximating narrow signal slices. The proposed filter remains provable parameter efficiency, with a novel Taylor-based parameter decomposition that achieves streamlined, effective implementation. With this foundation, we propose TFGNN, a scalable spectral GNN operating in a decoupled paradigm. We validate the efficacy of TFGNN via benchmark node classification tasks, along with an example graph anomaly detection application to show its practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM The Web Conference 2025, WWW 2025</p></details> |

However, the theoretical foundations underlying their empirical performance are not well understood. In this article, we examine the convergence of gradient dynamics in the training of linear GNNs. Specifically, we prove that the gradient flow training of a linear GNN with mean squared loss converges to the global minimum at an exponential rate. The convergence rate depends explicitly on the initial weights and the graph shift operator, which we validate on synthetic datasets from well-known graph models and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we discuss the gradient flow that minimizes the total weights at the global minimum. In addition to the gradient flow, we study the convergence of linear GNNs under gradient descent training, an iterative scheme viewed as a discretization of gradient flow.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network for EEG Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14246v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous neuroscientific studies have shown that human emotions are closely linked to specific brain regions, with these regions exhibiting variability across individuals and emotional states. To fully leverage these neural patterns, we propose an Adaptive Progressive Attention Graph Neural Network (APAGNN), which dynamically captures the spatial relationships among brain regions during emotional processing. The APAGNN employs three specialized experts that progressively analyze brain topology. The first expert captures global brain patterns, the second focuses on region-specific features, and the third examines emotion-related channels. This hierarchical approach enables increasingly refined analysis of neural activity. Additionally, a weight generator integrates the outputs of all three experts, balancing their contributions to produce the final predictive label. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets (SEED, SEED-IV and MPED) demonstrate that the proposed method enhances EEG emotion recognition performance, achieving superior results compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) address this by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predictive analysis and reasoning over incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs rely on predefined queries and lack autonomy and adaptability. This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.</p></details> | 12 Pages |
| **[Motif-aware Attribute Masking for Molecular Graph Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04589v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attribute reconstruction is used to predict node or edge features in the pre-training of graph neural networks. Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages.</p></details> |  |

Most recently, these attacks have been extended to target Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), revealing significant vulnerabilities. This new development naturally raises questions about the best strategies to defend GNNs against BFAs, a challenge for which no solutions currently exist. Given the applications of GNNs in critical fields, any defense mechanism must not only maintain network performance, but also verifiably restore the network to its pre-attack state. Verifiably restoring the network to its pre-attack state also eliminates the need for costly evaluations on test data to ensure network quality. We offer first insights into the effectiveness of existing honeypot- and hashing-based defenses against BFAs adapted from the computer vision domain to GNNs, and characterize the shortcomings of these approaches. To overcome their limitations, we propose Crossfire, a hybrid approach that exploits weight sparsity and combines hashing and honeypots with bit-level correction of out-of-distribution weight elements to restore network integrity. Crossfire is retraining-free and does not require labeled data. Averaged over 2,160 experiments on six benchmark datasets, Crossfire offers a 21.8% higher probability than its competitors of reconstructing a GNN attacked by a BFA to its pre-attack state. These experiments cover up to 55 bit flips from various attacks. Moreover, it improves post-repair prediction quality by 10.85%. Computational and storage overheads are negligible compared to the inherent complexity of even the simplest GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025, DOI will be included after publication</p></details> |

Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute-intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. This is unlike previous work in data driven design, where one can typically explicitly model the algorithmic behavior as a function of the hyperparameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter, our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.</p></details> | 48 pages, 4 figures |

The generated Inverse Kinematics is generalized to a family of manipulators with the same Degree of Freedom (DOF), but varying link length configurations. The results indicate a position error of less than 1.0 cm for 3 DOF and 4.5 cm for 5 DOF, and orientation error of 2$^\circ$ for 3 DOF and 8.2$^\circ$ for 6 DOF, which allows the deployment to certain real world-problems. However, out-of-domain errors and lack of extrapolation can be observed in the resulting GNN. An extensive analysis of these errors indicates potential for enhancement in the future. Consequently, the generated GNNs are tailored to be used in future work as an inductive bias to generate analytical equations through symbolic regression.</p></details> |  |

As datasets grow larger in real-world scenarios, the risk of exposing sensitive information increases, making privacy-preserving training methods like federated learning (FL) essential to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations. Recently proposed personalized subgraph FL methods have become the de-facto standard for training personalized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in a federated manner while dealing with the missing links across clients' subgraphs due to privacy restrictions. However, personalized subgraph FL faces significant challenges due to the heterogeneity in client subgraphs, such as degree distributions among the nodes, which complicate federated training of graph models. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{FedGrAINS}, a novel data-adaptive and sampling-based regularization method for subgraph FL. FedGrAINS leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to evaluate node importance concerning clients' tasks, dynamically adjusting the message-passing step in clients' GNNs. This adaptation reflects task-optimized sampling aligned with a trajectory balance objective. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of \textit{FedGrAINS} as a regularizer consistently improves the FL performance compared to baselines that do not leverage such regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SDM2025 (SIAM Data Mining 2025)</p></details> |

However, delivering FVV poses significant challenges due to the uncertainty in view switching, combined with the substantial bandwidth and computational resources required to transmit and decode multiple video streams, which may result in frequent playback interruptions. Existing approaches, either client-based or cloud-based, struggle to meet high Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements under limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address these issues, we propose VARFVV, a bandwidth- and computationally-efficient system that enables real-time interactive FVV streaming with high QoE and low switching delay. Specifically, VARFVV introduces a low-complexity FVV generation scheme that reassembles multiview video frames at the edge server based on user-selected view tracks, eliminating the need for transcoding and significantly reducing computational overhead. This design makes it well-suited for large-scale, mobile-based UHD FVV experiences. Furthermore, we present a popularity-adaptive bit allocation method, leveraging a graph neural network, that predicts view popularity and dynamically adjusts bit allocation to maximize QoE within bandwidth constraints. We also construct an FVV dataset comprising 330 videos from 10 scenes, including basketball, opera, etc. Extensive experiments show that VARFVV surpasses existing methods in video quality, switching latency, computational efficiency, and bandwidth usage, supporting over 500 users on a single edge server with a switching delay of 71.5ms.

Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

To help researchers develop more robust GNN models, it's essential to focus on designing strong attack models as foundational benchmarks and guiding references. Among adversarial attacks, gray-box poisoning attacks are noteworthy due to their effectiveness and fewer constraints. These attacks exploit GNNs' need for retraining on updated data, thereby impacting their performance by perturbing these datasets. However, current research overlooks the real-world scenario of incomplete graphs.To address this gap, we introduce the Robust Incomplete Deep Attack Framework (RIDA). It is the first algorithm for robust gray-box poisoning attacks on incomplete graphs. The approach innovatively aggregates distant vertex information and ensures powerful data utilization.Extensive tests against 9 SOTA baselines on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate RIDA's superiority in handling incompleteness and high attack performance on the incomplete graph.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Accelerating Graph Condensation: A Training-Free Approach with Class Partition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13707v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of large-scale graphs poses a significant challenge for graph neural network training, attributed to their substantial computational requirements. In response, graph condensation (GC) emerges as a promising data-centric solution aiming to substitute the large graph with a small yet informative condensed graph to facilitate data-efficient GNN training. However, existing GC methods suffer from intricate optimization processes, necessitating excessive computing resources and training time. In this paper, we revisit existing GC optimization strategies and identify two pervasive issues therein: (1) various GC optimization strategies converge to coarse-grained class-level node feature matching between the original and condensed graphs; (2) existing GC methods rely on a Siamese graph network architecture that requires time-consuming bi-level optimization with iterative gradient computations. To overcome these issues, we propose a training-free GC framework termed Class-partitioned Graph Condensation (CGC), which refines the node distribution matching from the class-to-class paradigm into a novel class-to-node paradigm, transforming the GC optimization into a class partition problem which can be efficiently solved by any clustering methods. Moreover, CGC incorporates a pre-defined graph structure to enable a closed-form solution for condensed node features, eliminating the need for back-and-forth gradient descent in existing GC approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGC achieves an exceedingly efficient condensation process with advanced accuracy. Compared with the state-of-the-art GC methods, CGC condenses the Ogbn-products graph within 30 seconds, achieving a speedup ranging from $10^2$X to $10^4$X and increasing accuracy by up to 4.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW '25)</p></details> |
| **[KAA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention for Enhancing Attentive Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13456v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) with attention mechanisms, often referred to as attentive GNNs, have emerged as a prominent paradigm in advanced GNN models in recent years. However, our understanding of the critical process of scoring neighbor nodes remains limited, leading to the underperformance of many existing attentive GNNs. In this paper, we unify the scoring functions of current attentive GNNs and propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KAA), which integrates the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architecture into the scoring process. KAA enhances the performance of scoring functions across the board and can be applied to nearly all existing attentive GNNs. To compare the expressive power of KAA with other scoring functions, we introduce Maximum Ranking Distance (MRD) to quantitatively estimate their upper bounds in ranking errors for node importance. Our analysis reveals that, under limited parameters and constraints on width and depth, both linear transformation-based and MLP-based scoring functions exhibit finite expressive power. In contrast, our proposed KAA, even with a single-layer KAN parameterized by zero-order B-spline functions, demonstrates nearly infinite expressive power. Extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks using various backbone models show that KAA-enhanced scoring functions consistently outperform their original counterparts, achieving performance improvements of over 20% in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Graphical Inverse Kinematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08812v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and reliably finding accurate inverse kinematics (IK) solutions remains a challenging problem for many robot manipulators. Existing numerical solvers are broadly applicable but typically only produce a single solution and rely on local search techniques to minimize nonconvex objective functions. More recent learning-based approaches that approximate the entire feasible set of solutions have shown promise as a means to generate multiple fast and accurate IK results in parallel. However, existing learning-based techniques have a significant drawback: each robot of interest requires a specialized model that must be trained from scratch. To address this key shortcoming, we propose a novel distance-geometric robot representation coupled with a graph structure that allows us to leverage the sample efficiency of Euclidean equivariant functions and the generalizability of graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach is generative graphical inverse kinematics (GGIK), the first learned IK solver able to accurately and efficiently produce a large number of diverse solutions in parallel while also displaying the ability to generalize -- a single learned model can be used to produce IK solutions for a variety of different robots. When compared to several other learned IK methods, GGIK provides more accurate solutions with the same amount of data. GGIK can generalize reasonably well to robot manipulators unseen during training. Additionally, GGIK can learn a constrained distribution that encodes joint limits and scales efficiently to larger robots and a high number of sampled solutions. Finally, GGIK can be used to complement local IK solvers by providing reliable initializations for a local optimization process.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict stresses on complex geometries for polycrystal plasticity from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, and aggregates to obtain embeddings and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. The GNN is trained on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals with complex geometries and learn the strain-stress maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are larger than 0.99. The proposed GNN approach speeds up more than 150 times compared with FEM on stress predictions. We also apply the trained GNN to unseen simulations for validations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. The GNN accurately predicts the von Mises stress on polycrystals. The proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data, as the error distributions demonstrate. This work outlooks surrogating crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 11 figures (main manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Inverse Design for High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08797v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) has significantly advanced the automation of digital circuits design, yet the need for expertise and time in pragma tuning remains challenging. Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE) adopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further optimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization due to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the design space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for HLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and generative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at compute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design features from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines, our method achieved an average improvement of 42.8% on average distance to reference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six benchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HierPromptLM: A Pure PLM-based Framework for Representation Learning on Heterogeneous Text-rich Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12857v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on heterogeneous text-rich networks (HTRNs), which consist of multiple types of nodes and edges with each node associated with textual information, is essential for various real-world applications. Given the success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in processing text data, recent efforts have focused on integrating PLMs into HTRN representation learning. These methods typically handle textual and structural information separately, using both PLMs and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). However, this separation fails to capture the critical interactions between these two types of information within HTRNs. Additionally, it necessitates an extra alignment step, which is challenging due to the fundamental differences between distinct embedding spaces generated by PLMs and HGNNs. To deal with it, we propose HierPromptLM, a novel pure PLM-based framework that seamlessly models both text data and graph structures without the need for separate processing. Firstly, we develop a Hierarchical Prompt module that employs prompt learning to integrate text data and heterogeneous graph structures at both the node and edge levels, within a unified textual space. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce two innovative HTRN-tailored pretraining tasks to fine-tune PLMs for representation learning by emphasizing the inherent heterogeneity and interactions between textual and structural information within HTRNs. Extensive experiments on two real-world HTRN datasets demonstrate HierPromptLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements of up to 6.08% for node classification and 10.84% for link prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRAMA: Adaptive Graph Autoregressive Moving Average Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12732v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph State Space Models (SSMs) have recently been introduced to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling long-range interactions. Despite their success, existing methods either compromise on permutation equivariance or limit their focus to pairwise interactions rather than sequences. Building on the connection between Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and SSM, in this paper, we introduce GRAMA, a Graph Adaptive method based on a learnable Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) framework that addresses these limitations. By transforming from static to sequential graph data, GRAMA leverages the strengths of the ARMA framework, while preserving permutation equivariance. Moreover, GRAMA incorporates a selective attention mechanism for dynamic learning of ARMA coefficients, enabling efficient and flexible long-range information propagation. We also establish theoretical connections between GRAMA and Selective SSMs, providing insights into its ability to capture long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on 14 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GRAMA consistently outperforms backbone models and performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN KAN Buff Signed Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00709v3)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Representation Learning aims to create effective embeddings for nodes and edges that encapsulate their features and relationships. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage neural networks to model complex graph structures. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network (KAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), offering improved accuracy and interpretability with fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose the integration of KANs into Signed Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs), leading to the development of KAN-enhanced SGCNs (KASGCN). We evaluate KASGCN on tasks such as signed community detection and link sign prediction to improve embedding quality in signed networks. Our experimental results indicate that KASGCN exhibits competitive or comparable performance to standard SGCNs across the tasks evaluated, with performance variability depending on the specific characteristics of the signed graph and the choice of parameter settings. These findings suggest that KASGCNs hold promise for enhancing signed graph analysis with context-dependent effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Heterogeneity and Uncertainty for Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis Models in Intelligent Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05559v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) has attracted much research interest due to its strong ability on inferring students' proficiency levels on knowledge concepts. While graph-based CD models have demonstrated remarkable performance, we contend that they still cannot achieve optimal performance due to the neglect of edge heterogeneity and uncertainty. Edges involve both correct and incorrect response logs, indicating heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a response log can have uncertain semantic meanings, e.g., a correct log can indicate true mastery or fortunate guessing, and a wrong log can indicate a lack of understanding or a careless mistake. In this paper, we propose an Informative Semantic-aware Graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (ISG-CD), which focuses on how to utilize the heterogeneous graph in CD and minimize effects of uncertain edges. Specifically, to explore heterogeneity, we propose a semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model. To minimize effects of edge uncertainty, we propose an Informative Edge Differentiation layer from an information bottleneck perspective, which suggests keeping a minimal yet sufficient reliable graph for CD in an unsupervised way. We formulate this process as maximizing mutual information between the reliable graph and response logs, while minimizing mutual information between the reliable graph and the original graph. After that, we prove that mutual information maximization can be theoretically converted to the classic binary cross entropy loss function, while minimizing mutual information can be realized by the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Finally, we adopt an alternating training strategy for optimizing learnable parameters of both the semantic-aware graph neural networks based CD model and the edge differentiation layer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of ISG-CD.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce "Abductive Past Action Inference", a novel research task aimed at identifying the past actions performed by individuals within homes to reach specific states captured in a single image, using abductive inference. The research explores three key abductive inference problems: past action set prediction, past action sequence prediction, and abductive past action verification. We introduce several models tailored for abductive past action inference, including a relational graph neural network, a relational bilinear pooling model, and a relational transformer model. Notably, the newly proposed object-relational bilinear graph encoder-decoder (BiGED) model emerges as the most effective among all methods evaluated, demonstrating good proficiency in handling the intricacies of the Action Genome dataset. The contributions of this research significantly advance the ability of deep learning models to reason about current scene evidence and make highly plausible inferences about past human actions. This advancement enables a deeper understanding of events and behaviors, which can enhance decision-making and improve system capabilities across various real-world applications such as Human-Robot Interaction and Elderly Care and Health Monitoring.

| **[A Unified Invariant Learning Framework for Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12595v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Invariant learning demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing the generalization of graph neural networks (GNNs) with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. It aims to recognize stable features in graph data for classification, based on the premise that these features causally determine the target label, and their influence is invariant to changes in distribution. Along this line, most studies have attempted to pinpoint these stable features by emphasizing explicit substructures in the graph, such as masked or attentive subgraphs, and primarily enforcing the invariance principle in the semantic space, i.e., graph representations. However, we argue that focusing only on the semantic space may not accurately identify these stable features. To address this, we introduce the Unified Invariant Learning (UIL) framework for graph classification. It provides a unified perspective on invariant graph learning, emphasizing both structural and semantic invariance principles to identify more robust stable features. In the graph space, UIL adheres to the structural invariance principle by reducing the distance between graphons over a set of stable features across different environments. Simultaneously, to confirm semantic invariance, UIL underscores that the acquired graph representations should demonstrate exemplary performance across diverse environments. We present both theoretical and empirical evidence to confirm our method's ability to recognize superior stable features. Moreover, through a series of comprehensive experiments complemented by in-depth analyses, we demonstrate that UIL considerably enhances OOD generalization, surpassing the performance of leading baseline methods.

This model combines supervised and self-supervised learning, taking into account for the loss function the embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features. The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components: embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN) transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings, incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with unknown structures.</p></details> |  |

This classification not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in natural language, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks, named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN) to better model the inherent structure of questions. By representing questions as graphs-where nodes signify words or phrases and edges denote syntactic or semantic relationships-our method allows the model to learn from the interconnected nature of language more effectively. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification performance on question datasets of various domains and characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model, augmented with these features, offer a promising solution for more robust and context-aware question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and practical educational applications of AI.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel SVGS-DSGAT model that combines GraphSage, SVAM, and DSGAT modules, enhancing feature extraction and target detection capabilities through graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. The model integrates IoT technology to facilitate real-time data collection and processing, optimizing resource allocation and model responsiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the SVGS-DSGAT model achieves an mAP of 40.8% on the URPC 2020 dataset and 41.5% on the SeaDronesSee dataset, significantly outperforming existing mainstream models. This IoT-enhanced approach not only excels in high-noise and complex backgrounds but also improves the overall efficiency and scalability of the system.

HIL simulation platforms enable the integration of computational models with physical devices, allowing rigorous testing across diverse scenarios critical to system resilience and reliability. In this study, we develop a SafePowerGraph-HIL framework that utilizes HIL simulations on the IEEE 9-bus system, modeled in Hypersim, to generate high-fidelity data, which is then transmitted in real-time via SCADA to an AWS cloud database before being input into a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model designed for power system state estimation and dynamic analysis. By leveraging Hypersim's capabilities, we simulate complex grid interactions, providing a robust dataset that captures critical parameters for HGNN training. The trained HGNN is subsequently validated using newly generated data under varied system conditions, demonstrating accuracy and robustness in predicting power system states. The results underscore the potential of integrating HIL with advanced neural network architectures to enhance the real-time operational capabilities of power systems. This approach represents a significant advancement toward the development of intelligent, adaptive control strategies that support the robustness and resilience of evolving power grids.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

To this end, the full adjacency matrix of the dependency graph is used to embed individual tokens using a graph convolutional network(GCN). An ablation study is also done to show the effect of the dependency graph on the overall performance. The results show a significant improvement when dependency graph information is used.

| **[Training Graph Neural Networks Using Non-Robust Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14738v6)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a highly effective neural network architecture for processing graph -- structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on the features of the data as input, GNNs leverage both the graph structure, which represents the relationships between data points, and the feature matrix of the data to optimize their feature representation. This unique capability enables GNNs to achieve superior performance across various tasks. However, it also makes GNNs more susceptible to noise from both the graph structure and data features, which can significantly increase the training difficulty and degrade their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method for selecting noise-sensitive training samples from the original training set to construct a smaller yet more effective training set for model training. These samples are used to help improve the model's ability to correctly process data in noisy environments. We have evaluated our approach on three of the most classical GNN models -- GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE -- as well as three widely used benchmark datasets: Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially boost the training of Graph Neural Networks compared to using randomly sampled training sets of the same size from the original training set and the larger original full training set.</p></details> |  |

To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

Spatio-temporal models combining mobility data with machine learning have gained attention for disease forecasting. Here, we explore Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) and Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (GCLSTM), which combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with traditional architectures that deal with sequential data. The aim is to forecast future values of COVID-19 cases in Brazil and China by leveraging human mobility networks, whose nodes represent geographical locations and links are flows of vehicles or people. We show that employing backbone extraction to filter out negligible connections in the mobility network enhances predictive stability. Comparing regression and classification tasks demonstrates that binary classification yields smoother, more interpretable results. Interestingly, we observe qualitatively equivalent results for both Brazil and China datasets by introducing sliding windows of variable size and prediction horizons. Compared to prior studies, introducing the sliding window and the network backbone extraction strategies yields improvements of about 80% in root mean squared errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Defense Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11568v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate significant potential in various applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can greatly degrade their performance. Existing graph purification methods attempt to address this issue by filtering attacked graphs; however, they struggle to effectively defend against multiple types of adversarial attacks simultaneously due to their limited flexibility, and they lack comprehensive modeling of graph data due to their heavy reliance on heuristic prior knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a more versatile approach for defending against adversarial attacks on graphs. In this work, we introduce the Graph Defense Diffusion Model (GDDM), a flexible purification method that leverages the denoising and modeling capabilities of diffusion models. The iterative nature of diffusion models aligns well with the stepwise process of adversarial attacks, making them particularly suitable for defense. By iteratively adding and removing noise, GDDM effectively purifies attacked graphs, restoring their original structure and features. Our GDDM consists of two key components: (1) Graph Structure-Driven Refiner, which preserves the basic fidelity of the graph during the denoising process, and ensures that the generated graph remains consistent with the original scope; and (2) Node Feature-Constrained Regularizer, which removes residual impurities from the denoised graph, further enhances the purification effect. Additionally, we design tailored denoising strategies to handle different types of adversarial attacks, improving the model's adaptability to various attack scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in defending against a wide range of adversarial attacks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |
| **[UniGraph: Learning a Unified Cross-Domain Foundation Model for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13630v3)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have revolutionized artificial intelligence, exhibiting remarkable abilities to generalize across a wide array of tasks and applications beyond their initial training objectives. However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Graph neural networks informed locally by thermodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13093v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermodynamics-informed neural networks employ inductive biases for the enforcement of the first and second principles of thermodynamics. To construct these biases, a metriplectic evolution of the system is assumed. This provides excellent results, when compared to uninformed, black box networks. While the degree of accuracy can be increased in one or two orders of magnitude, in the case of graph networks, this requires assembling global Poisson and dissipation matrices, which breaks the local structure of such networks. In order to avoid this drawback, a local version of the metriplectic biases has been developed in this work, which avoids the aforementioned matrix assembly, thus preserving the node-by-node structure of the graph networks. We apply this framework for examples in the fields of solid and fluid mechanics. Our approach demonstrates significant computational efficiency and strong generalization capabilities, accurately making inferences on examples significantly different from those encountered during training.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, multi-party dialogues involve more participants, each potentially discussing different topics, making the task more complex. Current methods often rely on graph neural networks to model dialogue context, which helps capture the structural dynamics of multi-party conversations. However, these methods are heavily dependent on intricate graph structures and dataset annotations, and they often overlook the distinct speaking styles of participants. To address these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based Multi-party dialogue Response generation model. CMR uses self-supervised contrastive learning to better distinguish "who says what." Additionally, by comparing speakers within the same conversation, the model captures differences in speaking styles and thematic transitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to apply contrastive learning in multi-party dialogue generation. Experimental results show that CMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in multi-party dialogue response tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Air Quality Mapping in Urban Areas Using Sparse Sensor Data, Satellite Imagery, Meteorological Factors, and Spatial Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11270v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring air pollution is crucial for protecting human health from exposure to harmful substances. Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast instance-specific algorithm configuration with graph neural network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11240v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are pivotal across various industrial applications, where the speed of solving these problems is crucial. Improving the performance of CO solvers across diverse input instances requires fine-tuning solver parameters for each instance. However, this tuning process is time-consuming, and the time required increases with the number of instances. To address this, a method called instance-specific algorithm configuration (ISAC) has been devised. This approach involves two main steps: training and execution. During the training step, features are extracted from various instances and then grouped into clusters. For each cluster, parameters are fine-tuned. This cluster-specific tuning process results in a set of generalized parameters for instances belonging to each class. In the execution step, features are extracted from an unknown instance to determine its cluster, and the corresponding pre-tuned parameters are applied. Generally, the running time of a solver is evaluated by the time to solution ($TTS$). However, methods like ISAC require preprocessing. Therefore, the total execution time is $T_{tot}=TTS+T_{tune}$, where $T_{tune}$ represents the tuning time. While the goal is to minimize $T_{tot}$, it is important to note that extracting features in the ISAC method requires a certain amount of computational time. The extracting features include summary statistics of the solver execution logs, which takes several 10 seconds. This research presents a method to significantly reduce the time of the ISAC execution step by streamlining feature extraction and class determination with a graph neural network. Experimental results show that $T_{tune}$ in the execution step, which take several 10 seconds in the original ISAC manner, could be reduced to sub-seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Spatial Disparity in Urban Prediction Using Residual-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: A Chicago Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11214v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban prediction tasks, such as forecasting traffic flow, temperature, and crime rates, are crucial for efficient urban planning and management. However, existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on accuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions. This oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate existing inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware Attention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these disparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating spatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of residuals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in Chicago, utilizing a travel demand dataset as an example. Our model achieved a 48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in error metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models with RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by reducing errors clustered in central regions. Attention maps demonstrated the model's ability to dynamically adjust focus, leading to more balanced predictions. Case studies of various community areas in Chicago further illustrated the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatial and demographic disparities, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Achieving Network Resilience through Graph Neural Network-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11074v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used in many important tasks of communication networks. In order to improve the perception ability of DRL on the network, some studies have combined graph neural networks (GNNs) with DRL, which use the GNNs to extract unstructured features of the network. However, as networks continue to evolve and become increasingly complex, existing GNN-DRL methods still face challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. Moreover, these methods are inadequate for addressing network security issues. From the perspective of security and robustness, this paper explores the solution of combining GNNs with DRL to build a resilient network. This article starts with a brief tutorial of GNNs and DRL, and introduces their existing applications in networks. Furthermore, we introduce the network security methods that can be strengthened by GNN-DRL approaches. Then, we designed a framework based on GNN-DRL to defend against attacks and enhance network resilience. Additionally, we conduct a case study using an encrypted traffic dataset collected from real IoT environments, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our framework. Finally, we highlight key open challenges and opportunities for enhancing network resilience with GNN-DRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Surrogates for Optimizing Transportation Policies with Agent-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11057v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper presents a first approach of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as surrogates for large-scale agent-based simulation models. In a case study using the MATSim model of Paris, the GNN effectively learned the impacts of capacity reduction policies on citywide traffic flow. Performance analysis across various road types and scenarios revealed that the GNN could accurately capture policy-induced effects on edge-based traffic volumes, particularly on roads directly affected by the policies and those with higher traffic volumes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Segmentation: Inducing graph-based learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03765v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) to enhance semantic segmentation across diverse image modalities. We evaluate the effectiveness of a novel GNN-based U-Net architecture on three distinct datasets: PascalVOC, a standard benchmark for natural image segmentation, WoodScape, a challenging dataset of fisheye images commonly used in autonomous driving, introducing significant geometric distortions; and ISIC2016, a dataset of dermoscopic images for skin lesion segmentation. We compare our proposed UNet-GNN model against established convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models, including U-Net and U-Net++, as well as the transformer-based SwinUNet. Unlike these methods, which primarily rely on local convolutional operations or global self-attention, GNNs explicitly model relationships between image regions by constructing and operating on a graph representation of the image features. This approach allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatial relationships, which we hypothesize will be particularly beneficial for handling geometric distortions present in fisheye imagery and capturing intricate boundaries in medical images. Our analysis demonstrates the versatility of GNNs in addressing diverse segmentation challenges and highlights their potential to improve segmentation accuracy in various applications, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

The metaverse, envisioned as a parallel virtual world, requires seamless real-time experiences across diverse applications. The study introduces a software-defined networking (SDN)-based architecture and employs graph neural network (GNN) techniques for intelligent and adaptive task allocation in in-network computing (INC). Considering time constraints and computing capabilities, the proposed model optimally decides whether to offload rendering tasks to INC nodes or edge server. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed GNN model, achieving 97% accuracy compared to 72% for multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 70% for decision trees (DTs). The study fills the research gap in in-network placement for real-time metaverse applications, offering insights into efficient rendering task handling.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRID: Protecting Training Graph from Link Stealing Attacks on GNN Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10985v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, they encounter the potential vulnerability from the link stealing attacks, which can infer the presence of a link between two nodes via measuring the similarity of its incident nodes' prediction vectors produced by a GNN model. Such attacks pose severe security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models. In this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID), to defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model utility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add carefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising adjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the graph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering all links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the further advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation cost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two adjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes and 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks under transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two influence-based attacks. Meanwhile, it achieves a much better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods when extended to GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312v4)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have performed remarkably well across diverse domains because they can represent complex relationships via unstructured graphs. However, the applicability of GNNs for visual tasks was unexplored till the introduction of Vision GNNs (ViG). Despite the success of ViGs, their performance is severely bottlenecked due to the expensive $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN) based graph construction. Recent works addressing this bottleneck impose constraints on the flexibility of GNNs to build unstructured graphs, undermining their core advantage while introducing additional inefficiencies. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Efficient Graph Convolution (DEGC) for designing efficient and globally aware ViGs. DEGC partitions the input image and constructs graphs in parallel for each partition, improving graph construction efficiency. Further, DEGC integrates local intra-graph and global inter-graph feature learning, enabling enhanced global context awareness. Using DEGC as a building block, we propose a novel CNN-GNN architecture, ClusterViG, for CV tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that ClusterViG reduces end-to-end inference latency for vision tasks by up to $5\times$ when compared against a suite of models such as ViG, ViHGNN, PVG, and GreedyViG, with a similar model parameter count. Additionally, ClusterViG reaches state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed globally aware learning strategy. Finally, input partitioning performed by DEGC enables ClusterViG to be trained efficiently on higher-resolution images, underscoring the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Our method integrates the foundation models CLIPSeg and Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the interest point detector SuperPoint and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to accurately segment machinery parts. By providing 1 to 25 annotated samples, our model, evaluated on a purely synthetic dataset depicting a truck-mounted loading crane, achieves effective segmentation across various levels of detail. Training times are kept under five minutes on consumer GPUs.

When benchmarked on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, it achieves a $J\&F$ score of 71.5 in semi-supervised video segmentation with three support samples.

While traditional spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in short-term traffic forecasting, their performance in long-term predictions remains limited. This challenge arises from over-squashing problem, where bottlenecks and limited receptive fields restrict information flow and hinder the modeling of global dependencies. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework that incorporates virtual nodes, which are additional nodes added to the graph and connected to existing nodes, in order to aggregate information across the entire graph within a single GNN layer. Our proposed model incorporates virtual nodes by constructing a semi-adaptive adjacency matrix. This matrix integrates distance-based and adaptive adjacency matrices, allowing the model to leverage geographical information while also learning task-specific features from data. Experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of virtual nodes significantly enhances long-term prediction accuracy while also improving layer-wise sensitivity to mitigate the over-squashing problem. Virtual nodes also offer enhanced explainability by focusing on key intersections and high-traffic areas, as shown by the visualization of their adjacency matrix weights on road network heat maps. Our advanced approach enhances the understanding and management of urban traffic systems, making it particularly well-suited for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Graph Representations and Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08305v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) enables the analysis if complex temporal data, and thus serves as a cornerstone in various real-world applications, ranging from healthcare to finance. Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods. The code of the proposed benchmark is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CVI-yangwn/Benchmark-GNN-for-Multivariate-Time-Series-Classification}.</p></details> |  |
| **[RELIEF: Reinforcement Learning Empowered Graph Feature Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03195v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm has recently extended its generalization ability and data efficiency to graph representation learning, following its achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Initial graph prompt tuning approaches tailored specialized prompting functions for Graph Neural Network (GNN) models pre-trained with specific strategies, such as edge prediction, thus limiting their applicability. In contrast, another pioneering line of research has explored universal prompting via adding prompts to the input graph's feature space, thereby removing the reliance on specific pre-training strategies. However, the necessity to add feature prompts to all nodes remains an open question. Motivated by findings from prompt tuning research in the NLP domain, which suggest that highly capable pre-trained models need less conditioning signal to achieve desired behaviors, we advocate for strategically incorporating necessary and lightweight feature prompts to certain graph nodes to enhance downstream task performance. This introduces a combinatorial optimization problem, requiring a policy to decide 1) which nodes to prompt and 2) what specific feature prompts to attach. We then address the problem by framing the prompt incorporation process as a sequential decision-making problem and propose our method, RELIEF, which employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize it. At each step, the RL agent selects a node (discrete action) and determines the prompt content (continuous action), aiming to maximize cumulative performance gain. Extensive experiments on graph and node-level tasks with various pre-training strategies in few-shot scenarios demonstrate that our RELIEF outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches in classification performance and data efficiency.

Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions are employed to discretely and accurately represent the geometry of 3D conducting bodies. A concise and informative graph representation is then constructed by treating each RWG function as a node in the graph, enabling the flow of current between nodes. With the transformed graphs, GraphSolver is developed to directly predict real and imaginary parts of the x, y and z components of the surface current densities at each node (RWG function). Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of GraphSolver in solving CFIEs for 3D conducting bodies with varying levels of geometric complexity, including basic 3D targets, missile-shaped targets, and airplane-shaped targets.</p></details> | 10 pages,11 figures |

By leveraging a Bayesian non-parametric framework, BN-Pool employs a generative model capable of partitioning graph nodes into an unbounded number of clusters. During training, we learn the node-to-cluster assignments by combining the supervised loss of the downstream task with an unsupervised auxiliary term, which encourages the reconstruction of the original graph topology while penalizing unnecessary proliferation of clusters. This adaptive strategy allows BN-Pool to automatically discover an optimal coarsening level, offering enhanced flexibility and removing the need to specify sensitive pooling ratios. We show that BN-Pool achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

One common approach is to use Dijkstra's Algorithm, which produces the shortest path as well as the shortest distance. However, this option is computationally expensive when applied to large-scale networks. This paper proposes a novel fast framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs) which approximate the single-source shortest distance between pairs of locations, and predict the single-source shortest path subsequently. We conduct multiple experiments on synthetic graphs of different size to demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency of the proposed model. In real-world case studies, we also applied the proposed method of flood risk analysis of coastal urban areas to calculate delays in evacuation to public shelters during hurricanes. The results indicate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the GNN model, and its potential for effective implementation in emergency planning and management.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, unlike GNNs, FMs struggle to incorporate node features and generalise to unseen nodes in inductive settings. Our work bridges the gap between FMs and GNNs by proposing ReFactor GNNs. This new architecture draws upon both modelling paradigms, which previously were largely thought of as disjoint. Concretely, using a message-passing formalism, we show how FMs can be cast as GNNs by reformulating the gradient descent procedure as message-passing operations, which forms the basis of our ReFactor GNNs. Across a multitude of well-established KGC benchmarks, our ReFactor GNNs achieve comparable transductive performance to FMs, and state-of-the-art inductive performance while using an order of magnitude fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022)</p></details> |

Despite their great success, existing works primarily employ polynomial approximation to construct the filters, whereas another superior option, namely ration approximation, remains underexplored. Although a handful of prior works have attempted to deploy the rational approximation, their implementations often involve intensive computational demands or still resort to polynomial approximations, hindering full potential of the rational graph filters. To address the issues, this paper introduces ERGNN, a novel spectral GNN with explicitly-optimized rational filter. ERGNN adopts a unique two-step framework that sequentially applies the numerator filter and the denominator filter to the input signals, thus streamlining the model paradigm while enabling explicit optimization of both numerator and denominator of the rational filter. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of ERGNN over state-of-the-art methods, establishing it as a practical solution for deploying rational-based GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fast Searching of Extreme Operating Conditions for Relay Protection Setting Calculation Based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09399v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for the Extreme Operating Conditions (EOCs) is one of the core problems of power system relay protection setting calculation. The current methods based on brute-force search, heuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming can hardly meet the requirements of today's power systems in terms of computation speed due to the drastic changes in operating conditions induced by renewables and power electronics. This paper proposes an EOC fast search method, named Graph Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Graph D3QN), which combines graph neural network and deep reinforcement learning to address this challenge. First, the EOC search problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, where the information of the underlying power system is extracted using graph neural networks, so that the EOC of the system can be found via deep reinforcement learning. Then, a two-stage Guided Learning and Free Exploration (GLFE) training framework is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of reinforcement learning. Finally, the proposed Graph D3QN method is validated through case studies of searching maximum fault current for relay protection setting calculation on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. The experimental results demonstrate that Graph D3QN can reduce the computation time by 10 to 1000 times while guaranteeing the accuracy of the selected EOCs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[First Experiments with Neural cvc5](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09379v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>he cvc5 solver is today one of the strongest systems for solving first order problems with theories but also without them. In this work we equip its enumeration-based instantiation with a neural network that guides the choice of the quantified formulas and their instances. For that we develop a relatively fast graph neural network that repeatedly scores all available instantiation options with respect to the available formulas. The network runs directly on a CPU without the need for any special hardware. We train the neural guidance on a large set of proofs generated by the e-matching instantiation strategy and evaluate its performance on a set of previously unseen problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Overfitting in Graph Neural Networks via Feature and Hyperplane Perturbation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15081v8)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly used in semi-supervised settings. Previous research has primarily focused on finding appropriate graph filters (e.g. aggregation methods) to perform well on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. While these methods are effective, they can still suffer from the sparsity of node features, where the initial data contain few non-zero elements. This can lead to overfitting in certain dimensions in the first projection matrix, as training samples may not cover the entire range of graph filters (hyperplanes). To address this, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy. Specifically, by flipping both the initial features and hyperplane, we create additional space for training, which leads to more precise updates of the learnable parameters and improved robustness for unseen features during inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mitigate the overfitting caused by the initial features. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed technique increases node classification accuracy by up to 46.5% relatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothness Really Matters: A Simple Yet Effective Approach for Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11654v3)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) seeks to bridge distribution shifts between domains by transferring knowledge from labeled source graphs to given unlabeled target graphs. Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on aligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs) across domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited effectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given the sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies between source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node embeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain Structural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to perform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating structural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node representations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with neighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target graph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis shows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements across six transfer scenarios. The code is available in https://github.com/cwei01/TDSS.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, Accpected by AAAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Representation Learning with Localized Topological Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09178v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning on graphs is a fundamental problem that can be crucial in various tasks. Graph neural networks, the dominant approach for graph representation learning, are limited in their representation power. Therefore, it can be beneficial to explicitly extract and incorporate high-order topological and geometric information into these models. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to extract the rich connectivity information of graphs based on the theory of persistent homology. Our method utilizes the topological features to enhance the representation learning of graph neural networks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various node classification and link prediction benchmarks. We also explore the option of end-to-end learning of the topological features, i.e., treating topological computation as a differentiable operator during learning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical study provide insights and potential guidelines for employing topological features in graph learning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in JMLR 2025</p></details> |

In our research, we develop an innovative surrogate model for a traffic assignment when multi-class vehicles are involved. We do so by employing heterogeneous graph neural networks which use a multiple-view graph attention mechanism tailored to different vehicle classes, along with additional links connecting origin-destination pairs. We also integrate the node-based flow conservation law into the loss function. As a result, our model adheres to flow conservation while delivering highly accurate predictions for link flows and utilization ratios. Through numerical experiments conducted on urban transportation networks, we demonstrate that our model surpasses traditional neural network approaches in convergence speed and predictive accuracy in both user equilibrium and system optimal versions of traffic assignment.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Similarity-Quantized Relative Difference Learning for Improved Molecular Activity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09103v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of molecular activities is crucial for efficient drug discovery, yet remains challenging due to limited and noisy datasets. We introduce Similarity-Quantized Relative Learning (SQRL), a learning framework that reformulates molecular activity prediction as relative difference learning between structurally similar pairs of compounds. SQRL uses precomputed molecular similarities to enhance training of graph neural networks and other architectures, and significantly improves accuracy and generalization in low-data regimes common in drug discovery. We demonstrate its broad applicability and real-world potential through benchmarking on public datasets as well as proprietary industry data. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging similarity-aware relative differences provides an effective paradigm for molecular activity prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrystalGRW: Generative Modeling of Crystal Structures with Targeted Properties via Geodesic Random Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08998v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining whether a candidate crystalline material is thermodynamically stable depends on identifying its true ground-state structure, a central challenge in computational materials science. We introduce CrystalGRW, a diffusion-based generative model on Riemannian manifolds that proposes novel crystal configurations and can predict stable phases validated by density functional theory. The crystal properties, such as fractional coordinates, atomic types, and lattice matrices, are represented on suitable Riemannian manifolds, ensuring that new predictions generated through the diffusion process preserve the periodicity of crystal structures. We incorporate an equivariant graph neural network to also account for rotational and translational symmetries during the generation process. CrystalGRW demonstrates the ability to generate realistic crystal structures that are close to their ground states with accuracy comparable to existing models, while also enabling conditional control, such as specifying a desired crystallographic point group. These features help accelerate materials discovery and inverse design by offering stable, symmetry-consistent crystal candidates for experimental validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+12...</summary><p>10+12 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
